# TemBazuca
App that says if the movie you typed in has bazooka or not.

## But... why?
The idea for the app came up while I was watching Choque de Cultura and Julinho said that before watching a movie, he searches if there's bazooka in the movie. If there's not, he doesn't even watch it.

So i thought "would be cool if there was an app that says if a movie has bazooka or not". That's it.

## Available in Play Store (soon)
